    \section{Recruit Restaurant Visitor Forecasting Mile Stone
Report}\label{recruit-restaurant-visitor-forecasting-mile-stone-report}

    \subsubsection{OVERVIEW}\label{overview}

This Capstone Project aims at coming up with a model to forecast the
number of visitors to a restaturant on future date. Accurate forecasting
is possible using the restaurant's past reservation, visiting data,
geographical location, kind of day(whether it is a weekend/holiday),
Genre of food being offered and supplementary weather data in Japan. The
model is provided with restaurant id and Dates from the "golden
week"(holiday week in Japan that covers the last week of April and May
of 2017) for prediction of number of visitors.

    \subsubsection{The Client}\label{the-client}

The Client here is Recruit Holdings who wants to automate the process of
number of visitors a restaurant can expect in future date. The process
of predicting the number of visitors to a restaurant isn't a simple one.
It is dependent on so many factors like local restaurants competition,
weather of the place where the restataurant is located.

Recruit Holdings has unique access to the datasets that could make this
forecast possible. Recruit Holdings owns Hot Pepper Gourmet (a
restaurant review service), AirREGI (a restaurant point of sales
service), and Restaurant Board (reservation log management software).
From these sources the past reservation data, visitor count,
geographical information of the restaurants are made available.

This would serve the following purposes for the client. 1. How many
customers are expected to visit the restaurant in the golden week season
in Japan. 2. Effective Cost Management in purchasing ingredients,
Scheduling staff by knowing by the number of visiotrs. 3. Minimize the
loss involved with Inventory. 4. What's the most favorite genre of food
that people are eating.Knowing the taste of customers much better.

Knowing these things by the forecast model in advance the restauant can
focus more in giving better quality of food and service to the customers
visited. Additionally, factors that lead to the success of a restaurant
can be understood much better and could be guiding principles for new
restaurants.

    \subsubsection{Dataset}\label{dataset}

As part of the kaggle competition, Recruit Holdinigs has provided access
to the data(in csv format) which comes from two different sources it
owns AirREGI(a restaurant point of sales service), Restaurant Board
(reservation log management software) and Hot Pepper Gourmet( (a
restaurant review service).

1.) In the competition, date restrictions were given for train and test
set. 2.) The training data covers the dates from 2016 until April 2017.
3.) The test set covers the last week of April and May of 2017 and
covers a chosen subset of the air restaurants and intentionally spans a
holiday week in Japan called the "Golden Week."

The data comes in different .csv files air\_reserve.csv Reservation data
of restaturants in Air system hpg\_reserve.csv Reservation data of
restaturants in HPG system air\_store\_info.csv This file contains
information about select air restaurants about their location, type of
food serving hpg\_store\_info.csv This file contains information about
select hpg restaurants about their location, type of food serving
store\_id\_relation.csv This file allows you to join select restaurants
that have both the air and hpg system. air\_visit\_data.csv historical
visit data for the air restaurants. date\_info.csv basic information
about the calendar dates in the dataset like holiday information 

    \paragraph{Data Wrangling}\label{data-wrangling}

The first and foremost step is to load the given datasets and clean them
using pandas dataframes. As the data is in different files, need to
perform merge/ Join operations to present meaningful data for further
analysis in prediction

    

    \begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Performed Inner join between hpg\_reserve data and store\_id\_relation
  table based on 'hpg\_store\_id' to get intersection of the data 
\item
  Changed calendar dates in data from string to datetime format.
\item
  Mapped hpg stores with their equivalent air store ids as the final
  test set given is having air store ids for forecasting
\item
  Performed various joins on hpg and air system tables to get complete
  data in a single table for further analysis.
\item
  Added holiday column using date\_info table based on calendar date
\item
  Included min\_visitors, max\_visitors, median\_visitors,
  reserve\_visitors column
\item
  Added reserve\_time\_diff column which represents the time difference
  between reservation date and visited date.
\item
  After cleaning data, train and test data are stored separately as
  Train\_data.csv, Test\_data.csv files
\end{enumerate}

    \subsubsection{Exploratory Data visualization
Analysis}\label{exploratory-data-visualization-analysis}

In this section, various insights were presented based on data
visualization techniques

    \paragraph{Machine Learning}\label{machine-learning}

\begin{verbatim}
After getting the meaningful data for analysis, the final step woulde be building a Machine Learning model 
to predict the visitor count for a restaurant on a future date.
